John refers to Jesus as the Lamb of God in the Bible. In the end times prophecy of Revelation, John speaks of another figure called the Lamb. This figure lives and breathes today and whoever he is, he will be given the Scroll with the Seven Seals from the right hand of Jesus. There are two Lambs of God.

The End Times Lamb from Revelation is second in command to Jesus Christ on Earth.
