The first five books of the Bible were written by Moses. Moses has a lot of theories that were incorrect, but he was ahead of his time. We now know how the God created the solar system, the planet, and we know how God created life on Earth through evolution. Moses' theory of creation was wrong.

Adam and Eve were one of millions upon millions of humans that God chose to create the ruling family of Earth.

Noah's flood may have happened, but the theory that it engulfed the entire Earth and killed all but eight humans and two of every animal just does not hold up. The flood was not global and did not kill everyone. We would have clear genetic proof if this were so.
