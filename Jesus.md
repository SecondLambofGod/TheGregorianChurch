Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the Ruler of Earth. Jesus still has his body to this day and is alive. Higher Order Beings prevent Jesus' telomeres from degrading. Jesus is the one who searches hearts and minds which means he astral projects from his heavenly home to Earth to interact with humanity and set in motion God's plans for us. He died for three days and was resurrected and taught for 40 days then ascended to heaven. For the Lord a day is like 1000 years and 1000 years is like a day. Jesus will be gone 3000 years and then return to Earth as a God.
