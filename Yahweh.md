Yahweh is a 10,000 year old extraterrestrial of a race similar to human. He did everything the Lord did in the Bible first to make way for our Savior, Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus then goes over everything himself when he returns 1000 years from now using astral projection time travel. Yahweh, an alien, was the original Lord in the book, then Jesus uses time travel from the future to redo everything in the book as the Lord.
