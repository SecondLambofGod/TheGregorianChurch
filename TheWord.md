The Bible is not the Word of God. The Bible was written by humans who interpreted thoughts sent by angels from God. These humans were flawed and so their interpretations of God's teachings were not always totally moral. Good examples of this are the Bible's support of slavery or the denigration of homosexuals. Because God's ideas are filtered through angels and then humans, the Bible is the word of man, not the Word of God. It is the Word of Moses, the Word of John, the Word of Paul, the Word of Isaiah, etc. Even if someone in the Bible claims to have heard the voice of God, their writings are still not the Word of God because of their humanity. The true Word of God must be written by God Himself. Therefore the only real Word of God in the Bible is the 10 Commandments and Moses smashed those for some reason.
