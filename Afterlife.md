Everyone has eternal life. The three most common occurrences on Earth are reincarnation, starseeds, and Heaven. Some people are reincarnated into new bodies after they die either on Earth or on another planet. Some people wake up as aliens on other planets who had a dream living as a human on Earth. Those people are known as starseeds. The lucky ones get to go to a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy called Heaven. People who go to this planet are given clones of their bodies on Earth in perfect form and they retain their memories from their life on Earth as if they had never died.
