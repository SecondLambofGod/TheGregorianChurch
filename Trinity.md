The doctrine that God is three persons at once: himself, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, is false. Jesus is a seperate person from Lord God Almighty. The Most High God the Creator is the Holy Spirit. Lord God Almighty is a human of Earth born in the far future different than the Most High God. The Most High God lives outside this universe and, when he wants to, can be inside the minds of every being within this universe. The Trinity is a false doctrine. Jesus, Lord God Almighty, and the Holy Spirit are each individual, seperate beings.
