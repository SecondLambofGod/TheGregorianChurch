The universe is teeming with life. Life on other planets is as diverse as life on Earth. God created countless races of people within our universe on other planets. God has made an infinite number of other universes within upper dimensional spacetime. Upper dimensional spacetime is stacked upon our lower four dimensional spacetime which is stacked upon the dozen or so lower dimensional spacetime of string theory that are rolled up. We live in the middle space, but there is life within lower and upper dimensional spacetime too.
